# Agent Guidelines

- Place automated tests under the `tests/` directory and implement them with `pytest`.
- Prefer descriptive function and variable names that make webhook behaviour obvious.
- When adjusting prompts, explicitly call out requirements that must be preserved from Product Owner messages.
